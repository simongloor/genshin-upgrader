# Quick Start

Welcome to the Genshin Upgrader, the tools that helps you see the potential of your artifacts and characters in Genshin Impact.

Before we get started, it is important to understand that this tool will not calculate any damage increase for you. Instead, the upgrader looks at the artifacts and checks for each of your character builds, how many substats are valuable, missing, already wasted. For many builds, there is even a number of substats that will always be useless.

The valuable substats are color-coded. Each color represents a different type of substat.

The missing substats show the roll-chance with their height. By looking at the height of the bars, you can see how likely it is to get to that number of substats. For example, if the last missing substat covers half the height, you have a 50% chance to win all rolls when you level the artifact to the max.

Every artifact has been evaluated for every character build you have. Even the number of substats the character could additionally gain when leveling the artifact is shown. 

The highest possible improvement as well as the level of the artifact is shown on the artifact.

If the artifact is currently equipped, the wearer of the artifact is shown on its left side.

There is also an overview of all characters and their total substat rolls. On this overview, the artifacts show the number of substats that could have rolled better.

So how do we find artifacts that we might want to upgrade?

The Upgrader shows you two different lists. The first list shows your character builds and the second list shows your artifacts. Both lists can be filtered using the bar at the bottom of the screen.

Let's say we are currently running Emblem domains. This set is an amazing allrounder that works on many builds. When you filter for the set, all the characters that can use the set are shown. The same goes for the artifacts. When you filter for the set, only the artifacts of this set are shown.

The next filter allows you to switch between flower, feather and so on. If the piece can roll into different mainstats, you can also filter for these.

The last filter allows you to show offpieces. This means that the artifact is not part of the set you've chosen. This can be useful if you want to see if there are any artifacts that could be an upgrade even though they are not part of the set that is currently selected.

Now there is one more filter that is not selectable in the bar. When you click on a character, the list of artifacts is updated to only show the artifacts that would be an upgrade or sidegrade on the character. Also, if there is not already a specific set selected, the artifacts are filtered to only show the artifacts that the build wants to use.

The last thing you might have noticed is that the artifacts are already sorted and categorized roughly by the chance of getting an upgrade. If there is no character selected, you can also see artifacts with a trash-can-icon. These artifacts provide no upgrade for any build.

Now that you've seen how to explore your artifacts, let's see how you can set up the Upgrader for your account.

At the top you find the two buttons to import your artifacts and add your character builds. 

For the import of artifacts, you first need to scan your inventory. There are many options to do this. My favorite way is to open the free screen recorder OBS and make a video of scrolling through the inventory. It is important that you start on an artifact that is equipped to a character.

Now I'll open Artiscan and add the video. After a short automatic calibration the tool is ready to process the artifacts. After the processing is done, you can copy the result to the clipboard. In the Upgrader, you can simply paste the result into the text field and click on save.

If you want to save some time, you have also the option to only import the artifacts of a specific set. For this you would filter the inventory in the game for the set and select the set in the Upgrader before you paste the data.

Now that we have imported the artifacts, we'll want to add some builds. Again, we'll open the menu at the top of the screen.

First, we'll select the character we want to add a build for. At the bottom we click on "add build".

We now have an empty build that is equipped to Itto. If we are still prefarming artifacts for a character or we want to add multiple builds, we can select a different character that should wear the artifacts in the meantime.

Now we select the sets, mainstats and substats that the build wants to use. This should be quick and easy. If you don't know what stats to choose, you will find many guides online that can help you.
